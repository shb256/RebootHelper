# RebootHelper

RebootHelper has to run as an admin in order to create a systemwide task.
It creates a task in 8 hours that forces the system to reboot
The task will be deleted automatically after a reboot

RebootHelper will start in the bottom right corner with a count down.
You can hide the programm for 30 minutes or you can reboot right now

If for some case the user is able to kill the program, it will also reboot automatically in order of the task scheduler.
